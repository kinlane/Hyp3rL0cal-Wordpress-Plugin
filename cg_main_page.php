<h2>CityGrid Wordpress Plugin</h2>

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/citygrid_logo.jpg" align="right" width="200" style="padding: 15px;" />CityGrid provides a wealth of content from local businesses and places.  Using the <a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a> you can pull places including their address, city, state, zip code and phone number.  You can also pull a wealth of other content including photos, videos, reviews and offers.</p>

<p>This Wordpress plug allows you deploy a local business directory for any Wordpress blog.  This is mean to be more of a starter kit for other developers looking to build their own Hyper Local Wordpress add-on, but can also be used as is.</p>

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" align="right" width="300" style="padding: 15px;" />To use this module you will need to <a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/dashboard/registration">register for a CityGrid publisher</a>, enter it into your settings.  The system will work without a publisher code, but if you wish to take advantage of advertising or revenue sharing opportunities, you will need to have your own publisher code.</p>

<p>Once you have your publisher key you can enter it on the <a href="?page=<?php echo CG_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY . '/cg_settings_page.php'; ?>">plugin settings page</a>.
